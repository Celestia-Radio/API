Celestia Radio API
==================

This document is designed to document the various commands supported by the new Celestia Radio API that was initially developed by [Mark Seymour][email] in early April 2014, as well as outlining possible additions and upgrades to the API as time goes on.

The API itself uses Composer's `autoload` feature to automatically load classes as requiredâ€”no need to use `include` except for the autoload feature itself at the beginning of `index.php`.

The API can be used from <http://api.celestiaradio.com/>.

Methods
-------

With the API, the general format of the response is:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": { "...": "..." }
}
```
however `result` may contain any kind of object, depending on the method. If the API encounters an error, the response will be:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "An error message"
}
```

### /nowplaying

This method aggregates various pieces of data from different sources in order to make a plethora of data available, mainly for use in services such as [Hoofsounds][hs] as well as Celestia Radio's own [Aiko][azbot].

By default, the API makes available the current song as well as the previous 9 songs played. Due to an issue with Centova, if a DJ is on, anything played by the DJ as well as the AutoDJ in the background will be reported.

In order to minimize the amount of data sent by the API (and not necessarily to the aggregated APIs, *this may change in the future*), users can use `/nowplaying/current` to only retrieve the latest song data.
